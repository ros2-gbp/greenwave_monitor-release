# Contributing

We welcome PRs for new features or bugfixes, CI will automatically run automated tests on new PRs. You can also use the scripts/docker-test.sh to debug tests for a particular distribution locally.

## Sign Off

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off can not be accepted.
To sign off on a commit you simply use the --signoff (or -s) option when committing your changes:

```
$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

## Pre-commit hooks (linting, sign-off check, copyright check, etc.)

If you would like the linter and other checks to run on every commit use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```
sudo apt install uncrustify pipx
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit run --all-files  # try it out, this will run every commit now
```

On every commit now a series of checks will be run to ensure the changes are meeting this repositories requirements.

Uninstall pre-commit with:

```
pre-commit uninstall --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
```
